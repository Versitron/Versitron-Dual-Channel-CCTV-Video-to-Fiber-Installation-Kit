## What is a Dual-Channel CCTV Video to Fiber Kit?

A dual-channel CCTV video to fiber kit enables two analog video feeds from security cameras to be converted into optical signals and transmitted over a single fiber link. This approach extends the reach of traditional coaxial cabling, eliminates electromagnetic interference, and ensures stable video performance over longer distances. The kit supports standard CCTV formats and is suitable for both fixed camera installations and broader network infrastructure expansion.
